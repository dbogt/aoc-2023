## Background on Challenge
*Details on Advent of Code*
- the coding challenge has been organized by Eric Wastl (http://was.tl/) every December since 2015
- each day starting December 1 until Dec 24, a new puzzle will get released at midnight EST; the puzzles have 2 parts, an easy one earning you a "silver star" and a more difficult one earning a "gold star"
- there is technically no time limit to complete the puzzle, and you don't need to complete the previous day's challenges to get access to the next puzzle
- each year there is usually a fun story that connects the puzzles (e.g. saving Santa from the bottom of the ocean, etc.)
- the challenge itself doesn't have any prizes, except for "bragging rights"
- the challenges are technically program agnostic (you can solve them with python, c++, java, vba, even Excel for some of the days), but we'll be posting the Python hints/solutions in our slack channel
- you don't need to be a programming expert to solve the questions, but knowledge of basic programming concepts is recommended (e.g. looping, if statements, functions)
